MARKDOWN CHEAT SHEET FOR ADMINISTRATORS
========================================

This is a quick reference for formatting doctor preference files.


BASIC SYNTAX:
-------------

Headers (Section Titles):
  # Doctor Name          ← Use ONE # for the doctor's name at top
  ## Main Section        ← Use TWO ## for main sections
  ### Subsection         ← Use THREE ### for subsections

Paragraphs:
  Just type normally. Leave a blank line between paragraphs.
  
  Like this! This is a new paragraph.

Bullet Lists:
  - First item          ← Start line with dash and space
  - Second item
  - Third item

Bold Text:
  **This is bold**      ← Surround with double asterisks

Italic Text:
  *This is italic*      ← Surround with single asterisks


REAL EXAMPLE:
-------------

# Dr. Sarah Johnson

## Appointment Scheduling
Prefers **30-minute slots** for all appointments. Needs 10-minute buffer 
between patients. Never schedule before 9:30 AM.

## Patient Communication
- Phone calls preferred for urgent matters
- Email for routine questions
- Check messages at *9 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM*

## Coffee Preferences
Black coffee, **no sugar**, served in a mug (not paper cup).


COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
--------------------------

✗ WRONG:  #Dr. Smith          (no space after #)
✓ RIGHT:  # Dr. Smith

✗ WRONG:  -No space           (no space after dash)
✓ RIGHT:  - Has space

✗ WRONG:  **Bold*             (mismatched asterisks)
✓ RIGHT:  **Bold**

✗ WRONG:  ##Section           (no space after ##)
✓ RIGHT:  ## Section


TIPS FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS:
------------------------------

1. Use Notepad, NOT Microsoft Word
   (Word adds invisible formatting that breaks things)

2. Keep it simple
   (You only need headers and bullets for most things)

3. Copy from existing files
   (Easiest way to get started - just copy/paste and edit)

4. Save files with .md extension
   (Example: Dr_Smith.md, NOT Dr_Smith.txt)

5. Always leave blank lines between sections
   (Makes it more readable)


STEP-BY-STEP EDITING:
----------------------

1. Right-click the .md file
2. Choose "Open with" → "Notepad"
3. Make your changes
4. File → Save (or Ctrl+S)
5. Close Notepad
6. Double-click UPDATE_DOCTORS.bat
7. Refresh your browser
