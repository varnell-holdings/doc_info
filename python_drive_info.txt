PYTHON EXECUTION FROM D:\NOBUE - EXPLAINED
===========================================

Question: Python is on C:\, files are on D:\Nobue - will it work?

Answer: YES! Here's why:


HOW IT WORKS:
=============

When you run a batch file from D:\Nobue, here's what happens:

1. You double-click: D:\Nobue\UPDATE_DOCTORS.bat

2. The batch file runs this command:
   cd /d "%~dp0"
   
   This changes to the batch file's own directory (D:\Nobue)

3. Then it runs:
   python convert_doctor_data.py
   
   - "python" is found via Windows PATH (from C:\)
   - "convert_doctor_data.py" is found in current directory (D:\Nobue)


TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================

%~dp0 explained:
-----------------
%0      = Full path to the batch file
%~d0    = Drive letter (D:)
%~p0    = Path (\Nobue\)
%~dp0   = Drive + Path (D:\Nobue\)

So "cd /d %~dp0" means: "Change to D:\Nobue"


Windows PATH explained:
-----------------------
When you type "python", Windows searches:

1. Current directory (D:\Nobue) - Python.exe not here
2. Directories in PATH environment variable:
   - C:\Python311\
   - C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\
   - etc.

Python is found in PATH, so it runs!


WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
=========================

✓ Python stays on C:\ (as installed)
✓ Your app files go on D:\Nobue
✓ Batch files automatically find both
✓ No configuration needed!


FILE LOCATIONS:
===============

On C:\ (System):
----------------
C:\Python311\python.exe          ← Python executable
C:\Python311\Lib\                ← Python libraries
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe      ← Command prompt

On D:\Nobue (Your Files):
--------------------------
D:\Nobue\UPDATE_DOCTORS.bat      ← Batch file
D:\Nobue\convert_doctor_data.py  ← Python script
D:\Nobue\doctor_data\            ← Your data
D:\Nobue\doctor_html\            ← Generated HTML


EXECUTION FLOW:
===============

Step-by-step when you run UPDATE_DOCTORS.bat:

1. User double-clicks: D:\Nobue\UPDATE_DOCTORS.bat
   
2. Windows starts cmd.exe (from C:\Windows\System32\)

3. Batch file runs: cd /d D:\Nobue

4. Working directory is now: D:\Nobue

5. Batch file runs: python convert_doctor_data.py

6. Windows finds python.exe in PATH (on C:\)

7. Python runs convert_doctor_data.py (from D:\Nobue)

8. Script reads: D:\Nobue\doctor_data\*.md

9. Script writes: D:\Nobue\doctor_html\*.html

10. Done!


WHAT IF PYTHON ISN'T IN PATH?
==============================

If typing "python" doesn't work, you can specify full path:

In UPDATE_DOCTORS.bat, change:
   python convert_doctor_data.py

To:
   C:\Python311\python.exe convert_doctor_data.py

Or:
   C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe convert_doctor_data.py


HOW TO CHECK IF PYTHON IS IN PATH:
===================================

1. Press Win+R
2. Type: cmd
3. Press Enter
4. Type: python --version
5. Press Enter

If you see: "Python 3.x.x" → Python IS in PATH ✓
If you see: "'python' is not recognized" → Python NOT in PATH ✗


TO ADD PYTHON TO PATH:
======================

If Python is NOT in PATH:

Option 1 - Reinstall Python:
   1. Uninstall Python
   2. Reinstall Python
   3. CHECK "Add Python to PATH" during installation

Option 2 - Add manually:
   1. Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows
   2. Click "Environment Variables"
   3. Under "System variables", find "Path"
   4. Click "Edit"
   5. Click "New"
   6. Add: C:\Python311\ (or wherever Python is installed)
   7. Click OK, OK, OK
   8. Restart computer


NETWORK DRIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
==============================

Potential Issues:
-----------------
✗ Network drive disconnects
✗ Permissions issues
✗ UNC paths instead of drive letters

Solutions:
----------
✓ Map D:\Nobue as a persistent network drive
✓ Ensure "Reconnect at sign-in" is checked
✓ Grant proper read/write permissions
✓ Use UNC path if drive letter changes


EXAMPLE UNC PATH BATCH FILE:
=============================

If D:\ isn't available, you can use UNC path:

@echo off
cd /d "\\ServerName\ShareName\Nobue"
python convert_doctor_data.py
pause


TESTING:
========

To verify everything works:

1. Open Command Prompt

2. Type: cd /d D:\Nobue

3. Type: python --version
   (Should show Python version)

4. Type: python convert_doctor_data.py
   (Should run the script)

If all these work, your batch files will work!


SUMMARY:
========

Q: Python on C:\, files on D:\ - will it work?
A: YES! ✓

Key Points:
-----------
✓ Batch files use "%~dp0" to find their own location
✓ Python is found via Windows PATH
✓ Scripts are found in current directory
✓ Everything works seamlessly across drives


The batch files have been updated with "cd /d %~dp0" to ensure
they always work correctly, regardless of where they're run from!
